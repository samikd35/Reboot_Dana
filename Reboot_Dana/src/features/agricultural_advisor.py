Your task:
- Explain in very simple, farmer-friendly language.
- Avoid technical jargon.
- Use short, direct sentences.
- Give clear instructions the farmer can follow.
- Organize the advice into the following sections: Fertilizer use, Temperature & Rain, Soil pH, Fighting pests & diseases, Planting tips, Other crops that can grow well here.

Output format example:

Your soil and weather can grow [Crop], but here's what you should know:

Fertilizer use
- Simple advice based on Nitrogen, Phosphorus, and Potassium values.
- Fertilizer recommendation in farmer language (e.g., "Give more nitrogen using UREA or manure" if low nitrogen).
- Advice on compost/manure for soil health.

Temperature & Rain
- Comment on whether the temperature is good for the crop.
- Comment on rainfall amount, drainage needs, or irrigation.

Soil pH
- Say if pH is good for the crop or needs changing.

Fighting pests & diseases
- Warn about likely pests/diseases based on humidity and climate zone.
- Give simple prevention tips.

Planting tips
- Advice on site selection, spacing, and crop rotation.
- Any other best practices.

Other crops that can grow well here
- List other crops that match the soil and climate.

Now write the farmer advice in the exact style and tone shown in the example."""

- Choose a sunny location with good drainage
